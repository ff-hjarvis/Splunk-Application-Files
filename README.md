# Splunk-Application-Files
These files are supposed to pull Splunk Application files from one instance and distribute the app to anyone
who desires it. By implementing these files, one should also be able to make new dashboards and alerts in 
their instance and app will procedureally update, allowing people to share dashboards and alerts that they 
have made without needing to constantly download files.
